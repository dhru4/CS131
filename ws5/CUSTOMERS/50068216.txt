Very nice little book, this.
Another fine work from a true poetic master.
They could've corrected the 1928 edition's typos...
Different than, but equally as good as, the film
Enthrallingly sickening, sickeningly enthralling, wonderful!
As funny as choking on a toy poodle
Another conversion novel, but the best of those to date.
Absolutely wonderful
Grass' weakest effort, by far
The definitive book on odds-line making
Could have been snappier (but then so could George Bush!)
Fantastic, as usual
Excellent intro for novices
A guidebook to the imagination
Nice intro to James' style
The Modern Prometheus, revised
Bring it back into print! Please!
Preparation is nine-tenths of the law... prepare now.
Required reading
Where's the horses?
Almost great
Oates' finest by far...
Errors of fact, errors of judgment?
All hail the new Sotos
Unreadable
Of their first six, Skipp and Spector's worst by far
For the West completist only
The Pulitzer?
&quot;Original?&quot; In what way?
Could've used a good editor
Perfectly average Francis thriller
Wordy? An understatement
Close, but not quite
Amusingly cynical (and with Liz Lundberg to boot!)
Debut with much potential, albeit wasted
Triangles went out with Pythagoras
Other Walters novels worked better for me
Shameless emotional manipulation
Tolkien? Where?
&quot;Importance&quot; is relative
Junger could have benefitted from a few hours with Philbrick
The Bible As Literature
The Great American Novel
You, too, can be banned at every casino in Vegas!
Even the rocks can kill you.
Solid handicapping marred by glaring errors
Just like life... it's not enough of a wonderful thing
Good, but not up to the level of McEwan's masterwork
One of the finest I read in '99 by far
Paragraph breaks are good
A worthy addition to the Grass canon
Possibly the best of the &quot;eighties novels&quot;
Pastoral, in a twisted sort of way
Next time, show your work, please.
Ex-Lax, anyone?
The next John Grisham? Hardly.
Somewhat disappointing
Let's face it-- have you ever tried to fix a horse race?
Memoirs of a real geisha
It's not a poem, no matter what the cover says
Helen Hunt got her book
Another fine L'Engle novel
Bridget Jones, Vampire Hunter
Not his best, but still good
Contains one of King's finest short stories, hands down.
I wish he'd go back to horror...
Southern Gothic, take eighty-seven hundred ninety-two
Do we really need two more Californias after this one?
Greek tragedy, African style
Wow, the eighties really WERE that stupid
One of the best interpretations of Leroux's work yet
Face it, the guy's funny
Disaster of the week
Another excellent book from Koja
BMI strikes again
Donw-home ramblin'
For Grass completists
One of the finest novels ever written
Pretty good, actually
Time-lapse photography book-style
You can do better.
The comparisons to Greene are almost warranted
It's Spenser, what more do you need to know?
Every clown cries inside.
The amazing conclusion to the Danzig Trilogy
Just another adventure novel
The second part of the Danzig Trilogy holds up just as well
John T. Connolly: savior or fluke?
Save us from the eighties!
Don't believe the hype.
A worthy addition to the library
Lost in the translation?
The fungi are coming...
Exactly what it promises: a new view.
Sotos' best since Total Abuse
God as the infinitely-dimensional
Object-oriented language
As close to classical tragedy as American fiction comes.
