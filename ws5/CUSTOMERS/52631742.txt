Self-indulgent, melodramatic teenage fantasy
Thrown across the room after three chapters
Should have picked a different period to write about
It went on and on and on... Stop already!
Entertaining but frustrating
Fascinating mix of historical and fantasy
Super tedious
I wanted to like this, I really did, but...
What WAS this??
Dark-Hunters are back, and as tantalising as ever!
Good continuation of Twilight series, but VERY frustrating
Sequel fails to grip as much as the original
Dreadful! Destined for the trash!
Disappointing characters makes this less than sparkling
Disappointingly ponderous
Adored book 1; book 2 disappointing
Well-written, but strains credulity somewhat
Sweet, enjoyable tale of young love overcoming obstacles
Why, oh WHY do authors put ongoing series in ANTHOLOGIES?
The chocolate-selling duke or the doctor?
One star for plot; zero for historical accuracy
More of a duck than a skylark
A preachy polemic, not a romance novel

A mixed-up tapestry...

If you only read one prison diary, make it this one

Showed promise, but could have been much better
Wings in the Night creator fails to live up to expectations
Going downhill...
Some useful insights, but marred by excessive ego

She�s hunting her man... but which one does she want?

Here we go again: Cynster plot-line repeated once more
'Immaculate Contraception' strikes yet again
Her past catches up with her...

Very different Regency
Same plot as Devil�s Bride...
Silly names and transparent plot, but readable
Very mixed feelings about this one
Melodrama with insufficient romance
Melodrama with insufficient romance
Thoroughly enjoyable escapist fun
Unromantic and pretty horrible, really.
Only worth it for the Jo Beverley story - others are awful

Be mine for ever... no, go away, we can never be together!
Abysmal - couldn�t even finish it
A real discovery: an anthology worth keeping!
The outcast with the heart of gold
Another hit-and-miss anthology: one dud, two so-so, two good

Revenge is sweet... or is it?
An antidote to hit-and-miss Christmas anthologies
