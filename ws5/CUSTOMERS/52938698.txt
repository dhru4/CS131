Thoughtful and lyrical
Not exactly what I expected
Rockford, Illinios?? Are you kidding me? But it works!
Just finished it last night, dammit
Implausibly mesmerizing
Don't read this book when you're alone at night
Kvetch, Kvetch, kvetch...
If you like Anne Lamott's style, you'll LOVE this book
Dense, but worth it
Fascinating interweave of myth with reality
One of the most engaging books I've ever read
Please, please, please read this book
Please, please, please read this book
Wolf never takes personal responsibility
Really, really good - but she needed a better editor
Took a leap of faith to write this book...
Quiet, elegant, perceptive, mesmerizing.
Unredeeming; implausible; unjustified
I had to go out and buy another little can of book darts
she has a story to tell
I raced to the end of this book
Forgive me, but I just can't resist anything by Carl Hiaasen
I never saw the end coming. Masterful conclusion!
Sweet, but not believable
It cast a spell on me
Not what I expected
Better than i expected
memoir masquerading as fiction
Is there some way to award 10 stars?
lyrical and dispassionate
She did it first!
He's going to put the rest of us writers out of business
The Book I've Been Waiting For
