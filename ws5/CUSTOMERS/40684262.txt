Trace, Patricia Cornwell
.
sucessful collection
funny, eccentric, ingenious!
excellent short story collection
superb debut
Astouding quality
very interesting work on forensics
adequate is the word
Possibly her best book
My continual rantings about Rendell must be getting tiresome
Another delightful Brunetti experience
eh?
Sharp, focused mystery
Another superb early Wexford story
what the heck...
A descent too far
One of Rendell's masterpieces
The best crime writer anywhere in the world today - still!
14th fine Wexford novel
Brilliant international crime novel - mordant yet seductive
Maybe Grisham's finest work
Brilliant! Stunningly intelligent
Outstanding crime fiction
brilliant debut
absolutely splendid!
excellent book and addition to the series
compelling literary pageturner - interesting themes
nothing new to see here - pass it by
Unusual - possibly not for all tastes
more first-class fiction
as pure as crime fiction gets
Brilliant - mature and riveting as only Rendell can be
Clever, surprising, powerful
Possibly the most deserving Booker winner of all time!
More wonderful stuff from Rendell!
Debut of the year?
A brilliant panorama, original and very important
A delightful little tale
Ruth Rendell is truly amazing
Brilliant - mature and riveting as only Rendell can be
Excellent historical thriller
Not her strongest....but still superior
Prime Patterson!
original, haunting, brilliant!
amazing
Not as bad as these reviews make it seem
The rains came down/the floods came up
Brilliantly insightful
another excellent Rendell novel
Pratchett having rollicking fun
Impressive effort
Something rotten in the state of St. Andrews
nice strong novel from Slaughter - promising indeed
Pretty bad, if I'm honest, but enjoyable!
Entertaining, easy, different
More great work from Iles
Absolutely amazing thriller - top of any list
exquisite stuff from Rendell
A joy to read. Yet another excellent book
A joy to read. Yet another excellent book
Entertaining, easy, different
very good, effective thriller
very good, effective thriller
It does not get better than this
Excellent mystery
Absolutely stunning
Satisfactory, but not as good as some others in the series
In short, only try this if you liked When the Wind Blows
It's absolutely great, but...
My favourite Delware book so far
Excellent crime writing
dont be misled by all the great reviews...
setback in a series that was gathering speed
What it lacks in plot, it makes up for with Bosch!
Quite frankly, wonderful
Very good, but ending is too contrived
Excellent! Best book so far!
Classic Delware entry
Average Walters
A thriller that delivers
brilliant. what do you expect?
Okay. 3.5
Deaver's Penned a Killer!
Light, forgettable, but nontheless a thrilling adventure!
The jest's on you!
Fantastic!
Great thriller. Great setting. Great characters.
wonderful, delicate thriller
Passes the second-novel test with enviable ease...
Good serial killer novel
Absolutely delightful story
Hits his stride!
Not quite the best, but certainly a strong entry!
worth the wait!
So, his latest books are disappoiting, are they?
traditional, unchallenging British mystery
debut to die for!
another masterpiece
fantastic, completely enchating and intriguing debut
Fabulous serial killer thriller!
All's well that ends well
great crime novel
Solid, enjoyable, but unspectacular
fresh life into the series
Exemplary novel by Vine
Well, 13 obviously isn't unlucky for Rankin....
very adequate
Possibly best serial killer book since &quot;Silence OTL&quot;
Quite simply wonderful
Excellent serial killer book
Possibly the best in this series
One of the gems from the early days
High Quality Debut
Reccomended to all Rankin admirers
Reccomended to all Rankin admirers
Interesting, but at times dull
once, twice, three times a brilliant thriller
More from Rendell on top form
can't muster enthusiasm for it
Excellent. Enjoyable and exciting
Fascinating!!!
Another excellent book
rather uninspiring...
A return to form! Fans, buy it!
Fantastic!!!
remarkable
another fine entry
He's still got it! (Well, who ever doubted it.)
first class historical mystery AND ghost story
where did all those pages go?
Entertaining collection
relatively solid tale from the back catalogue
Best since The Concrete Blonde
If serial killings are your thing, try this 4.5* effort
Excellent legal thriller
One of the best in the series
Doesn't always work
Very strong
Rendell certainly isn't mellowing with age!
Now and then he produces a book like this....
Confusing, messy, poorly written. Enjoyable.
a real treat
Best thriller you'll read this year

Dead and Buried
Altogether average
Incredibly effective
Out of all so far, this one is the most brilliant
Forget Ellis Peters
Absolutely first class
One of the best
Another wholly unexpected solution
Sheer brilliance
Chilling and puzzling
Not her best, but very enjoyable nonetheless
Christie-lite
The Innocencts
Quite quite average
Exciting and scary
Good start
Best short story collection ever
Very impressive debut
Emotionally draining
Forget old Edith, Clare is the new Queen

Florentine Delights
As Peter Straub says, probably the best supernatural novel..
Stunning

A great debut
Her best ever. so it must be pretty damn excellent.
Rankin, but down a different path
Not half bad, actually
A great, great thriller
Still very fine, but not great...
The best one so far...but....
Not at all bad
5 stars just isnt enough
Proves he is worthy
Definitely not his best work
Not as good as some might claim.
Signs of weakness
Extremely good
Ummmmmm
The best, by the best
Is this the best book you'll ever read? &quot;YES!&quot;
No. Enough is Enough
fast as ever. Still not well written
Her best yet. The most wonderful British author for years.
Brilliant plot driven novel
2.5 stars really
There IS life without Cross
Not all that brilliant
Superb. A Big Book in Every Way
Superb. A Big Book in Every Way

One bad egg is forgiveable
