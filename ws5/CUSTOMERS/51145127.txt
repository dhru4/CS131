Fun Goth-fiction
Defender
The home front
Good, but fatally flawed
Smooth writing, great setting, improbable plot
Alternate what?
Startlingly unhelpful source
Excellent memoir
Disappointing
&quot;Survivor&quot; for the nineteenth century
Historical fiction doesn't get much better than this series.
Good.. and bad and good and bad...
Readable, but logically flawed
Beautiful imagery, a little weak elsewhere
Interesting concept, but too unbelievable for me
Interesting source, disappointingly edited
Character-driven, slightly implausible, historical fiction
Readable, but not great literature
Deeply problematic book
Plodding, implausible and mundanely written
Jo Clayton, at her best and worst
Tendentious, emotional pseudohistory; covers no new ground
Intelligent and enjoyable SF

Wonderful book based on period memoirs
Very interesting study, but contains doubtful analysis
Very useful source for the general reader
Disappointingly unbelievable
Disjointed and rather scanty memoir
The best in the series; readable but still flawed
Intelligent, but too cold for me
Unreadable pseudo-literature
Very informative -- and very dry
Who to blame?

Sensible, useful brief study
Flawed but reasonably good young adult novel
Wonderful narrative
A fascinating premise, but almost completely unsupported
Useful but limited
Interesting, but disturbing, memoir
Good -- but could have been great
Fails to be believable
They're like Doritos: you can't read just one
Narrative account with many quotes
Useful but not very entertaining
Wonderful compilation of many letters
Very useful reference
Shallow and tendentious
Research is not enough
Informative but very dry

This is the best
Tells it like it was
Limited
Bizarre and very mixed book

Most of these stories are at a very low standard
Mixed feelings
Very useful reference
Useful but limited
An amazing book far transcending genre
Ignore the text
Characters in search of motivations
Narrative account which spreads blame widely
Very detailed account of overlooked part of battle
First person account, very interesting in unexpected places
Definitely a classic
Significant work of literature
Not well written, and limited in research
Condescending missionary writing
Interesting but questionable scholarship
Groping for literature...
A great book for the amateur or beginner
The basis for the movie Riding with the Devil
Strange and interesting book; needs modern edition
Superficially literary, but founded on no research
A kinder, gentler Cornwell
Sort of a mixed bag
Fun &quot;mind candy&quot; historical fiction
Very good historical scholarship
Pretty well done, but a little cold
The classic narrative historian does it again
Clearly a labor of love... but ultimately doesn't work.
A tragic book about a driven person

Fun, readable historical mystery
Interesting but flawed
Appallingly bad and historically inaccurate
Interesting, but not entirely successful, Shaara pastiche
A useful book for the specialist, less for amateurs
A valuable source -- but...
Amazing, transgressive, crushingly depressing
A strangely uneven book
Unfortunately, a dissenting opinion
A compilation of three excellent, bizarre novels
An old-fashioned but still excellent history
How much more wooden can characters get?
Treacle
Very good collection
Well told but not wildly exciting
Reads like a rapid overview
A chill, laconic voice
Annapurna: the heroic facade
An amazing book
This is as real as it gets
Excellent, but somehow insufficient
Excellent with a few annoying flaws
The bumblie perspective
Good for the armchair adventurer
This is what fantasy should be.

Not unreadable, but disappointing
This is a stupid, stupid book.
Exactly what a guidebook should be
An excellent study, but only for specialists
Not &quot;canonical&quot; Darkover, but fun anyway
An excellent anthology
Very good on gear placements; somewhat confusing elsewhere
Contains tons of useful information
Unreadable and historically inaccurate
Undeniably classic, yet strangely flawed
A good but limited instructional book
One of the best
Another installment in Willis' anthology series
Ideal companion volume to Five Miles High
A certain style of expedition...
Bonington at his best
Interesting story, but too much rehash
Beautifully written, but ultimately disappointing
Something of a disappointment
A good graphic novel, but only peripherally Elfquest
Interesting, but read it as fantasy
Another excellent installment...
Sick alpinism at its best
Don't bother.
Enjoyable but imperfect - And a reconsideration several years later
For the want of an editor...
My favourite book by my favourite author
Readable, but does it add anything new?
Fun reading, but adds nothing new
Moments of brilliance, long stretches of torpor
Gibson still has what it takes
Decent but flawed
Tanith Lee at her best
Very disappointing from an excellent author
Classic fantasy
Ghostbusters for Grownups
Far from Holland's best work
Far below the best of Elfquest
Holland at her best
Holland at her best
What historical fiction should be
An excellent read, but not the author's best
Pleasantly readable, but not gripping
Every climber I know owns this book.
The guidebook with a sense of humor
Less than Thrilling
Recommended
Beautiful writing... but what else?
Better than Everest: Mountain Without Mercy.
A Romantic Classic
Camp 4
Much better than I expected!
Amazing arrogance
Funniest Thing since Downward Bound
More subtle than it appears...
Lackey wrote it, not Cherryh.
Why not just read the original books?
Why can't they all be this good?
Gruesome, Gripping, but Not Well Written
Well written and, in retrospect, frightening
Famous climber does not equal great writer...
If you can find it, buy it!
Gorgeous and full of information
If you can find a copy, go for it!
You have to ask the right questions...
Worth reading...
OK, But...
There are better books out there...
