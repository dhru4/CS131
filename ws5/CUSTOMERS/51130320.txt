Perhaps the best of the trilogy
Not as funny as the first, but still a great read

Superb (and unlikely) heroine
The heroine never really owned her own mistakes
Abysmal

Some good, some not so...
Oddly disappointing
Witty and warm with some serious subjects thrown in
Average
The misunderstandings get very old
Delightful. 4.7 stars.

Some good, some ordinary
Just a hair under 5 stars
In the minority here

Give it 3.5 stars
Romantic, very funny, but incomplete
Interesting and different
mediocre for Krahn
OK, but less than stellar
Little substance -- or genuine humor
Moderately interesting
Realistic and heartwarming
A roller coaster ride
I, for one, enjoyed it.
A light, fun, quick read  --  3.5 stars
Finished in haste
Hardly Metzger's best
A difficult book to rate
Lots of good elements but mediocre execution
Runs the gamut
Utterly perfect!

The best of the trilogy
Worth reading, but not top notch
Ewen & Felicity are a terrific couple
Another intriguing couple
I was very pleasantly surprised by this book

This series MUST be read in order
Average Metzger fare
Ho hum
Delightful
Not for me
3 & 1/2 stars; imperfect but good
A fun book with a pair of delightful leads
Fitzroger is imminently suitable
1/2 decent if unremarkable & 1/2 truly wretched
Two & 1/2 stars, really
Three, maybe three & 1/2 stars
Definitely not Enoch's best
A tightly constructed plot w/ a full cast of good characters
Great romance
I seem to be in the minority here
Excellent debut novel
A good follow-up to A Perfect Gentleman
In order to really enjoy this book,
Celeste Bradley  is back
One quite nice, one only mediocre
Unique & compelling
Patience required to read the book to the end
Yuck!
The title doesn't fit
At the opposite end of the spectrum...
Three & 1/2 to three & 3/4 stars
Not my cup of tea
Cyn is the key
Middle of the road for the series
Average
I'm enjoying this series very much
Completely unbelievable
Better than expected; not the best of series
Okay but could have been better
A good start to the trilogy
My favorite of the trilogy

Seriously quirky
Immediately one of my all-time favorites
3 silly tales
One of the best Christmas anthologies available
The best I have read of Jordan's books
Ignore the ridiculous title & cover art
An enchanting read
Mediocre and flawed
Pick & choose or divide it up so you're not overwhelmed

3 & 1/2 to 4 bright Christmas stars
You have to buy into the magic
Do NOT read this one for Woodiwiss
It's okay.
Odd and dark but interesting

Very amusing
A thoroughly implausible Cinderella tale
not as good as # 3

One of the best Regencies I've read
Avoid this one
My favorite in the series

A good start to a new series

A delightful holiday romp
It's been a while since I read this, but...
one of the better books of its kind
Delightful
Not Kleypas' best
Mixed feelings
A very pleasant surprise
A witty & engrossing read
2 & 1/2 stars; pleasant, but uninspired
Far better than average for this sort of book -- 3 & 1/2 *
Not as great as I had hoped -- 3 & 1/2 stars
4 & 1/2 for lack of emotional depth in a sweet story
Read the series in order
Enchanting lead characters in an uneven book
A good read, but the heroine gets annoying
up to 4 stars for the charts
On my "must buy" list
Four & 1/2, almost 5, stars
Good, but not the best I've read
A very good review book
Starts 1350 with the Renaissance
Couldn't bear to read it all
Hits the highlights
A resource to use with others
Thoroughly captivating
Sometimes engaging, sometimes confusing. An uneven book.
An emotional wonderland with fascinating characters
Really 3 & 1/2 stars; it's better than a mere 3 indicates
The elements just didn't come together
The basics & then some
Not comprehensive, but a beautiful overview
From mediocre to awful; about 1 & 1/2 stars total
light & airy
book = not compelling; ideas = helpful
or 3 & 1/2. Great characters, slow pacing
Not the best of the series
My favorite of the series to date
3 & 1/2 stars; imperfect but good
3 & 1/2 stars is more accurate
Much better than its predecessor
I can't quite give it 4 stars
Exceptional; better than 5 stars
A mixed bag; useful if cross-referenced
A lovely ending to the series
Get out the tissues
I liked this one a great deal until
Another need for 4 & 1/2 stars.
Exceptionally good book
The series gets better with book two
Maybe 4 & 1/2 stars; excellent resolution to series
The best so far (in my opinion)
or 3 & 1/2 -- good but hardly great
3 & 1/2 stars is more accurate
bittersweet, rather Romeo & Juliet
Sweet & light
4  & 1/2 stars; a wonderful novel
If you're looking for something different, this is it
Fairly ordinary
Very enjoyable
Spoiled brat meets arrogant autocrat -- Ugh!
I'd give it 4 &amp; 1/2 stars if I could
A mixed bag but better than the usual anthology
A thing of beauty
Intriguing hero & realistic heroine
somewhere between 4 &amp; 1/2 and 5 stars
Another feather in JQ's cap
Good but not great; too convoluted 3 &amp; 1/2 stars
4 &amp; 1/2 stars -- wonderful lead characters
My favorite of the Templeston trilogy
Unrealized potential
Interesting characters &amp; an interesting plot
4 &amp; 1/2 stars really; an entertaining read
Good romance, bad mystery = a mixed result
I wanted to like it, but the writing is terrible
reader opinions vary greatly on this one
Very enjoyable medieval romance
A solid 4 & 1/2 stars
A diverting read with 2 excellent secondary characters
A prickly heroine &amp; a truly noble hero
4 &amp; 1/2 stars--this one REALLY needs the 1/2 star
Not as bad as the reviews
Different, funny, and a decent mystery too
Engrossing, with a real subplot
Possibly the best series Regency book
Thoroughly enjoyable
Sabrina 1843 w/ more romance &amp; a stronger heroine
OK, but enough with the spies already
A reworking of &quot;Sommersby&quot;
Ugh! A truly terrible hero.
questionable science, but Heyeresque characters
A worthy follow-up to The Pretender
Another enchanting entry in the series
Good but not the best in the series
A new writer for my favorites list
My favorite of them all so far
2 &amp; 1/2 stars -- the least appealing of the series
Sometimes you want to brain the hero and
An adventure I can do without
Sometimes worthy reading, but not up to snuff
2 &amp; 1/2 stars; rather pleasant, but uninspiring
Mediocre; not nearly as good as its sequel
4 &amp; 1/2 stars; my favorite Heyer to date
4 &amp; 1/2 stars
Lots of potential, but lots of problems
Excellent, sometimes riveting
Do not start this book at bedtime...
Just shy of 5 stars
It should have been better
A delightful Regency romp
Only the darkness in it kept this from getting 5 stars
Captivating; significantly better than the first in series
Three stars, but just barely
Deep and moving; pure romance
An Elizabethan treasure
Just shy of 5 stars, actually, but classic TM
I liked this one better than The Bridal Season
Immense disappointment
Not Laurens' best, but better than the first in series
Flawed but entertaining; 3 &amp; 1/2 stars
Sensual and delicious
A most entertaining sequel
Not quite 4 stars; maybe 3 &amp; 1/2
Makes medeival times fun
Not as good as the first two
An excellent debut with hints of Jane Austen
I'd have expected more if not for the reviews
Enjoyable but not top rate -- 3 & 3/4 stars
I'd be willing to burn the book
A love-hate relationship
The good, the bad, and the boring
4 &amp; 1/2 stars; would have been 5 with an epilogue
Only a hairsbreadth from perfection
I really wanted to like this book...
Not as funny as reviews indicated
Laugh out loud funny
Such a sweet--and sometimes bittersweet--love story
Sweet &amp; pleasant, though not exceptional
Light in a dark time
I was wary after reading negative reviews...
Not my favorite by this author
Quieter, more realistic; but warm and beguiling
An emotional roller coaster -- and just as thrilling
Unconvincing story but fun read
but not a perfect book
In some ways, the best of the trilogy
Really 3 &amp; 1/2, but as part of the series, I give it 4
A splendid read, but alas, there is no more.
Way up there on the enjoyability scale...
I can't remember enough I liked to give it 2 stars
Maybe 3 &amp; 1/2 -- Lucien's great; best as part of series
A mixed bag
What is it about heroes named Rafe?
My problem is not so much the story itself...
Full of emotional power
A book you either like or hate....
An imperfect heroine &amp; a hero who doesn't care
Not quite perfect
Kleypas' worst novel
Wonderfully written with just the right emotional touches
Slightly harsh perhaps, but a disappointing book
Definitely not Laurens' best
This is why Suzanne Enoch is one of the best
Different and entertaining -- 3 and 1/2 stars
Not quite 5, but better than 4 stars
Pleasant, but not Enoch's best
Average:  1 star for Maxwell; 4 &amp; 1/2 for Carlyle
NOW, I like Freyja
Medeiros always writes beautifully
Oh, so witty
Another time when 1/2 stars would be nice -- 3 &amp; 1/2
I loved this book; it had me laughing out loud!
Nurse and patient? The dread Duke has met his match.
I'd prefer 3 &amp; 1/2 stars, but I won't go down to 3
A wonderful hero & heroine
A mixed bag for me
Not as good as An Affair to Remember
Perfectly wonderful!
Sweet, humorous, and very sexy...
For a light read, it's quite good
Uneven as always; Metzger's quite good (4 stars)
One of the better anthologies
4 &amp; 1/2 would be more accurate, but...
Amazing how some books get published!
Not only a pleasure to read, but an honor.
Good, but not Medeiros' best
And so the Bedwyn series begins
I had to stay up til the wee hours to finish it!
Repetitious and yet.....
I adored this book
Tying up lots of loose ends
3 & 3/4...?  A quick, interesting, & sexy read
Actually 4 and 1/2 stars... excellent but not my favorite
a disappointment for me from a favorite author
Past choices and emotional pain
Another winner for Beverley
a gentle romance
A clear 3 &amp; 1/2 stars -- pity I can't rate it as such
Oh, heavens... I couldn't even bring myself to finish it
Not on par with the best, but a nice little story
Arguably the best of the series
Taking top honors in the tragic hero category...
Not as good as Devil's Bride
2 &amp; 1/2 stars: good writer but questionable hero and...
Some historical issues, but well-done nonetheless
Wishing I could rate it higher
Looking beneath the surface
Oh, dear...
Mystery &amp; romance
Another winner from Kleypas
Ordinary except for the strong emotional pull of the heroine
Ross Cannon is definitely dreamworthy
A beautiful story of love against all the odds
a welcome addition to the Bride Finder series
highly uneven quality
Book 3 makes you want another in the series
a pleasant, quick read
Unique style and an engossing storyline
Unique and utterly wonderful
unrealized potential
Really 2 &amp; 1/2, but pleasant enough to move up to 3 stars
yes &amp; no
An anthology of the highest caliber
one of the better series anthologies
The healing power of love
not her best, but good
Nice but nothing special
Unabashed liberal propaganda
Not for the well-read or well-educated
Frustrating and limited
